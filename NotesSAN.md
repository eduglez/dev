# UPGRADE NOTES

- Upgrades are determined by FMA needed SN version.

- ServiceNow mandates to do at least 1 upgrade per year. In this case skipping one version in the middle.

- Merging and take note of what needs to retest. All the sensitive files should be retested.


- Check the XML when no differences as the embedded records are not included in the differences. If the previous version comes from an upgrade no problem, but if the previous version comes from a custom update set it's needed to review it. This applies to ChoiceLists, Record producers, etc...

- The skipped errors, are files without previous version so cannot be compared. Can be directly marked as Reviewed



Go to Global Helper Controller after the upgrade



## IFA

Choicelist => set to Reviewed

sys_metadata_link => Theses are demo datea => Set to Reviewed

Variables item_opt => Review and Retained. In Santander they change the help text so they will be always there.

Revert all changes installed by update set


## FMA
3d per upgrade FMA without checking customizations (collisions)
3d to 7d depending on the collisions depends on how long it takes.
